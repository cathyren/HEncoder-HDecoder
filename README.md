# HEncoder-HDecoder
Encoder and Decoder based on the user input password to encode the given ASCII text file using Huffman tree.

Install: 
  Please download all files in order to compile successfully. Makefile will generate two executables, "HDecode" and "HEncode"

Usage:
  'HEncode' takes a filename as commandline arguement. It will ask the user to give input as a password, and will output the encoded binary file to stdout.
  'HDecode' takes a filename as commandline arguement. It will ask the user to give input as a password, and ask again to prevent possible typos. Then it will output the decoded text to stdout.

Demo:
$ ./HEncode toEncode.txt > encode.out
Enter password:
## pw42
Please enter again:
## pw42
$ ./HDecode encode.out > myfile.txt
Enter password:
WARNING: Wrong password will get you unreadable messy code.
## pw42
$ diff toEncode.txt myfile.txt
$

Note: The input file should only contain ASCII charators.
      Only when encoding password and decoding password match so the correct original file will be outputed.
      If the password given in HDecode is wrong, unreadable messy code will be given.
