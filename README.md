# HEncoder-HDecoder
Encoder and Decoder based on the user input password to encode the given ASCII text file using Huffman tree.
  
[中文说明](https://github.com/dragonhades/HEncoder-HDecoder/blob/master/README-zh.md).  
  
Install:
---------
  Please download all files in order to compile successfully. Makefile will generate two executables, "HDecode" and "HEncode". Compiler used is g++ -std=c++14

Usage:  
--------
  * 'HEncode' takes a filename as commandline arguement. It will ask the user to give input as a password, and will output the encoded binary file to stdout.  
  * 'HDecode' takes a filename as commandline arguement. It will ask the user to give input as a password, and ask again to prevent possible typos. Then it will output the decoded text to stdout.  
  * 'runTest.sh' is a bash script yo help testing. It takes a filename as commandline argument, and use 'diff' command as result of output.  

Demo:
-----
```bash
$ ./HEncode toEncode.txt > encode.out  
Enter password:  
pw42  
Please enter again:  
pw42  
$ ./HDecode encode.out > myfile.txt  
Enter password:  
WARNING: Wrong password will get you unreadable messy code.  
pw42  
$ diff toEncode.txt myfile.txt  
$  
```
  
Note:
-----
 * The input file should only contain ASCII charators.  
 * Only when encoding password and decoding password match so the correct original file will be outputed.  
   If the password given in HDecode is wrong, unreadable messy code will be given.
